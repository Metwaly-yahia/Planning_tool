# A simple planning tool
A simple planning tool is used by a service provider that owns 340 channels in the 900 MHz (2G) band. The code asks for the GOS, city area, user density, SIRmin and sectorization method. The blocked calls are assumed to be cleared in this system. Then, it produces the following design parameters:
-	   Cluster Size.
-	   Number of cells.
-	   Cell radius.
-	   Traffic intensity per cell, and traffic intensity per sector.
-	   Base station transmitted power.
